A Wi-Fi controlling car is a small vehicle that can be operated remotely using a Wi-Fi connection. The car is typically controlled via a smartphone, tablet, or computer through an app, allowing users to navigate the car by sending commands over the internet. This type of car offers the advantage of a greater operating range compared to traditional Bluetooth-controlled cars, as Wi-Fi signals can cover larger distances and provide more stable control.
